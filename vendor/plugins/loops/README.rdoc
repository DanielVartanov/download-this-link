= Simple background loops framework for rails and merb

loops is a small and lightweight framework for Ruby on Rails and Merb created to support simple 
background loops in your application which are usually used to do some background data processing 
on your servers (queue workers, batch tasks processors, etc).


== What tasks could you use it for?

Originally loops plugin was created to make our own loops code more organized. We used to have tens 
of different modules with methods that were called with script/runner and then used with nohup and 
other not so convenient backgrounding techniques. When you have such a number of loops/workers to 
run in background it becomes a nightmare to manage them on a regular basis (restarts, code upgrades, 
status/health checking, etc).

After a short time of writing our loops in more organized ways we were able to generalize most of the 
loops code so now our loops look like a classes with a single mandatory public method called *run*. 
Everything else (spawning many workers, managing them, logging, backgrounding, pid-files management, 
etc) is handled by the plugin itself.


== But there are dozens of libraries like this! Why do we need one more?

The major idea behind this small project was to create a deadly simple and yet robust framework to 
be able to run some tasks in background and do not think about spawning many workers, restarting 
them when they die, etc. So, if you need to be able to run either one or many copies of your worker or 
you do not want to think about re-spawning dead workers and do not want to spend megabytes of RAM on 
separate copies of Ruby interpreter (when you run each copy of your loop as a separate process 
controlled by monit/god/etc), then I'd recommend you to try this framework -- you'd like it.


== How to install?

To install this plugin you need to do a few steps:
* To install the plugin, you can use the following command:

    ./script/plugin install git://github.com/kovyrin/loops.git

This will install the whole package in your vendor/plugins directory.
For merb applications, just check out the code and place it to the vendor/plugins directory.

* Generate binary and configuration files by running 

    ./script/generate loops 

This will create the following list of files:
* <tt>./script/loops</tt> - binary file that will be used to manage your loops
* <tt>./config/loops.yml</tt> - example configuration file
* <tt>./app/loops/simple.rb</tt> - REALLY simple loop example
* <tt>./app/loops/queue_loop.rb</tt> - simple ActiveMQ queue worker


== How to use?

Here is a simple loop scaffold for you to start from (put this file to app/loops/hello_world_loop.rb):

  class HelloWorldLoop < Loops::Base
    def run
      with_period_of(1) do # period is in seconds
        debug("Hello, debug log!")
        sleep(config['sleep_period']) # Do something "useful" and make it configurable
        debug("Hello, debug log (yes, once again)!")
      end
    end
  end

When you have your loop ready to use, add the following lines to your (maybe empty yet) config/loops.yml 
file:

  hello_world:
    type: simple
    sleep_period: 10

This is it! To start your loop, just run one of the following commands:

* To list all configured loops:

    $ ./script/loops -L

* To run all enabled (actually non-disabled) loops in foreground:

    $ ./script/loops -a

* To run all enabled loops in background:

    $ ./script/loops -d -a

* To run specific loop in background:

    $ ./script/loops -d -l hello_world

* To see all possible options:

    $ ./script/loops -h


== How to run more than one worker?

If you want to have more than one copy of your worker running, that is as simple as adding one 
option to your loop configuration:

  hello_world:
    type: simple
    sleep_period: 10
    workers_number: 1  

This _workers_number_ option would say loops manager to spawn more than one copy of your loop 
and run them in parallel. The only thing you'd need to do is to think about concurrent work of 
your loops. For example, if you have some kind of database table with elements you need to 
process, you can create a simple database-based locks system or use any memcache-based locks.


== ActiveMQ-based workers? What's that?

In some of our worker loops we poll ActiveMQ queue and process its items to perform some 
asynchronous operations. So, to make it simpler for us to create such a workers, we've created 
really simple loops class extension that wraps your code with basic queue polling/acknowledging 
code and as the result, you can create a loops like this:

    class MyQueueLoop < Loops::Queue
      def process_message(message)
        debug "Received a message: #{message.body}"
        debug "sleeping..."
        sleep(0.5 + rand(10) / 10.0) # do something "useful" with the message :-)
        debug "done..."
      end
    end

With configs like this:

    # An example of a STOMP queue-based loop
    my_queue:
      type: queue
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 61613
      queue_name: blah

Of course, this solution scales perfectly and to make your queue processing faster you just 
need to add more workers (by adding <tt>workers_number: N</tt> option).

_Warning_: This type of loops requires you to have stomp plugin installed in your system.


== There is this <tt>workers_engine</tt> option in config file. What it could be used for?

There are two so called "workers engines" in this plugin: <tt>fork</tt> and <tt>thread</tt>. They're used 
to control the way process manager would spawn new loops workers: with <tt>fork</tt> engine we'll 
load all loops classes and then fork ruby interpreter as many times as many workers we need. 
With <tt>thread</tt> engine we'd do Thread.new instead of forks. Thread engine could be useful if you 
are sure your loop won't lock ruby interpreter (it does not do native calls, etc) or if you 
use some interpreter that does not support forks (like jruby).

Default engine is <tt>fork</tt>.


== What Ruby implementations does it work for?

We've tested and used the plugin on MRI 1.8.6 and on JRuby 1.1.5. At this point we do not support 
demonization in JRuby and never tested the code on Ruby 1.9. Obviously because of JVM limitations 
you won't be able to use +fork+ workers engine in JRuby, but threaded workers do pretty well.
